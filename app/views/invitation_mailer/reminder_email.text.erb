Dear <%= @name_of_dearness.to_s %>,

We have yet to receive your RSVP for our wedding. Please send us your response
as soon as you're able to so we can be sure to order enough tasty little bread
and cheese appetizers to fill everyone up.

View the details and RSVP with the following link.

We hope you can join us! (The bread and cheese things are so good...)

With love,
- Kate and Mike
